# German-Elections-2021

The project is aiming to get a better understanding of the 2021 german parlamentary elections, incorporating vizualization methods, statistical tests and a Logistic Regression in order to classify the non-conservative/conservative patterns of voting in the regions of Germany. It was also part of the examination for the lecture "Data Science 1" in the Winter Semester 2021/2022 at the Univeristy of GÃ¶ttingen.
